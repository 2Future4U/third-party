# End-to-end checklists
{: #checklist}

Use the following checklists to track all the tasks required to define, develop, and publish your integrated billing service.

## Define your offering

| Task | Subtasks | Description | Environment |
|------| ----------| ------------|-----|
| Learn about the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform. | ☐ I understand how the provisioning layer, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM, the catalog, the OSB, and the metering service all work together to for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform. | Unlike and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} referral service, an integrated billing service uses the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform to create, bind, delete, and charge for service instances. [Learn](/docs/third-party/platform.html#what-is-the-ibm-cloud-platform-) about the critical components that comprise the platform to jump-start your development! | Documentation |
| Register in PWB | ☐ Completed the **Content Task** in PWB <br><br>☐ I obtained approval to publish my offering as an integrated billing service <br><br> ☐ I obtained an initial email with my documentation URL value <br><br> | Your first step is to register your offering with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} PWB. For more information on completing this task see the [Getting started tutorial](/docs/third-party/index.html#get-started). | PWB |
| Author and publish {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} docs | ☐ I started the **Guidance Task (Documentation)** in PWB <br><br>☐ I obtained my `Documentation URL` <br><br> ☐ I successfully published my docs <br><br> | We know that your third-party documentation hosted on your own website is great. However, now that you're delivering an integrated billing service in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you need to deliver documentation customized to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} integrated billing experience. PWB will guide you through this task, and help you to publish your docs to https://console.bluemix.net/docs/. For more information on completing this task see: [Create your getting started documentation](/docs/third-party/cis1-docs-marketing.html#docs) | PWB |
| Author and publish marketing announcement | ☐ I started **Marketing Task (Announcement)** in PWB <br><br>  ☐ I successfully published my announcement <br><br>  | Create marketing collateral to announce availability for your service through the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} newsletter and social media channels. PWB will guide you through this task. For more details, see: [Create your getting started documentation](/docs/third-party/cis1-docs-marketing.html#announcement) | PWB |
| Register your service in the resource management console | ☐ I defined a unique and meaningful `service-name` as my **Resource Name**<br><br>  ☐ I successfully saved and validated I have a record in resource management console <br><br>  | Resource management console will help you create a unique offering. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis2-rmc-define.html#register-your-offering-by-using-the-resource-management-console-rmc-) to register your offering. | Resource management console |
| Complete the **Offering** page in the resource management console | ☐ Using the value provided in my PWB offering email, I correctly set my **Documentation URL** and **Instruction URL**<br><br>  ☐ I provided a **Terms of Service** URL that isn’t my company TOS page, but a unique TOS page with no billing or payment clauses.<br><br>  ☐ I understand and correctly specified whether **Plan changes supported?** is enabled. ☐ I understand and correctly specified whether my service is **Bindable**.| Provide catalog metadata in the resource management console that will display in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tile., including critical URLs like Terms of Service, and meaningful details about your offering like information bullets and more. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis2-rmc-define.html#enter-your-offering-metadata-rmc-offering-page-) to set required and recommended catalog metadata for your offering. | Resource management console |
| Complete the **Access Management** page in the resource management console | ☐ I successfully enabled IAM<br><br>  ☐ I saved the one-time generated IAM API key that the resource management console UI created for me, and I understand that the API key isn’t stored in the resource management console and I can’t retrieve it later.<br><br> ☐ I understand that the Access Management page can’t be completed until I develop and host an OSB in later steps, and then derive my redirect URI.<br><br> ☐ After creating and hosting my OSB, I returned to the IAM page and successfully completed the page by clicking **Add Redirect URI** and adding my derived value.| Register your offering with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) in the resource management console. IAM enables you to securely authenticate users for both platform services and control access to resources consistently across the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform. (You’ll come back and enable your redirect URI). Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis2-rmc-define.html#register-with-identity-and-access-management-rmc-iam-page-) to enable your offering's initial access management. | Resource management console |
| Develop one or more pricing plans in the resource management console | ☐ I provided a free plan with a unique name.<br><br>  ☐ (Optional) I worked with my IBM representative to define a paid plan, (subscription or metered), and I understand that in order to create a metered plan I must remove the default subscription plan.<br><br> ☐ (Optional) I understand that metered plans required me to host and develop automated hourly usage submission using the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform metering service.| How will you charge for your offering? The resource management console provides free or paid (subscription and metered) plans. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis2-rmc-define.html#develop-a-pricing-plan-rmc-pricing-page-) to define your offering's pricing plan. | Resource management console |
| Export your catalog metadata from the resource management console| ☐ I understand that some of the metadata I provided in the resource management console **Offering** and **Pricing** pages must be exported and provided in my OSB. By exporting values from the resource management console I can map critical GUIDs like my service and plan IDs that the resource management console generated for me, and provide them in my OSB so that the platform provisioning layer can read this provisioning contract from the response of my `catalog GET` endpont. <br><br>  ☐ I obtained my `catalog.json` file from the resource management console **Deployments** page, and am ready to map the services array to the metadata in my OSB.<br><br> | Now that you defined your service within the resource management console, you can download a catalog.json file and use it to inform the development of your Open Service Broker. The catalog.json contains metadata that must be hosted in your broker. These values define the contract between the broker and the IBM Cloud platform for the services and plans that the broker supports. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis2-rmc-define.html#export-your-metadata-as-json-rmc-deployments-page-) to export your catalog metadata. | Resource management console |

## Develop your offering

| Task | Subtasks | Description | Environment |
|------| ----------| ------------|-----|
| Learn about the Open Service Broker (OSB) specification version 2.12 | ☐ I have read through the OSB spec and I understand that I must develop my own OSB. <br><br>  |  Service brokers manage the lifecycle of services. The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform interacts with Open Service Brokers to provision and manage service instances (an instantiation of a service offering) and service bindings (The representation of an association between an application and a service instance, which often contain the credentials that the application will use to communicate with the service instance).[Learn](/docs/third-party/cis3-broker.html#become-familiar-with-the-osb-specification) about the version 2.12 specification | Documentation |
| View our {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} broker samples | ☐ I have cloned the repo, looked through the broker samples and am ready to use these samples to begin development. <br><br>  |  [https://github.com/IBM/sample-resource-service-brokers](https://github.com/IBM/sample-resource-service-brokers){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") | Code examples |
| View our {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Open Service Broker API Documentation | ☐ I understand that there are several required endpoints that the code in my OSB must support. <br><br>  ☐ I understand that if my service can be bound to applications in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, it must be able to return API endpoints and credentials to my service consumers. <br><br> ☐ I understand that {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} has defined extended API endpoints that allow service instances to be disabled and reenabled. I must extend my OSB and define the **enable and disable instances (GET and PUT)** |  The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Open Service Broker extends the Open Service Broker 2.12 specification. [Learn](/docs/third-party/cis3-broker.html#view-our-resource-broker-api-documentation) about required endpoints your broker must use | Documentation |
| Use your catalog metadata to begin developing your broker | ☐ I understand that some of the metadata I provided in the resource management console **Offering** and **Pricing** pages must be exported and provided in my OSB. By exporting values from the resource management console I can map critical GUIDs like my service and plan IDs that the resource management console generated for me, and provide them in my OSB so that the platform provisioning layer can read this provisioning contract from the response of my `catalog GET` endpoint. <br><br>  ☐ I added the required GUIDs and other required values listed in my `catalog.json` file to the services array in my sample OSB. | After downloading a `catalog.json` file from the resource management console, you can use it to inform the development of your Open Service Broker. The catalog.json contains metadata that must be hosted in your broker. These values define the provisioning contract between the broker and the IBM Cloud platform for the services and plans that the broker supports. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis3-broker.html#learn-how-to-use-the-exported-metadata-to-guide-your-broker-development) to add you exported catalog metadata to your OSB. | Development environment and documentation |
| Host your OSB | ☐ I understand that the hosted location of my broker must follow Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2. Additionally, my broker must be hosted on a valid HTTPs endpoint that is accessible on the public internet. <br><br> | Your broker must be hosted as part of an application that can respond to REST API calls. And your hosted location must meet IBM Cloud security guidelines. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis3-broker.html#host-your-brokers) to host your broker. | Development environment and documentation |
| Test your hosted OSB | ☐ I validated each of the API endpoints my broker supports by running curl commands against your hosted broker and validating the responses. <br><br> | You should be validating your broker by running curl commands against the different endpoints you’re enabling. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis3-broker.html#how-to-test-your-service-s-broker) to host your broker.| Development environment and documentation |
| Derive and set your IAM redirect URI | ☐ I successfully derived my IAM redirect URL by using the hosted location of my OSB and some authentication information. <br><br> ☐ I successfully completed the resource management console **Access Management** page by specifying my **Redirect URI** and correctly setting my Client ID. <br><br> | When you defined your service in resource management console, you generated a Client ID, but note that you likely didn’t have a Redirect URI at the time. This means IAM created a Client ID that is set to `false`. Until you return to the resource management console with your **Redirect URI**, you won't have a true Client ID. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis5-iam.html#derive-your-iam-redirect-uri-resource-management-console-iam-page-) to derive and set your IAM redirect URI. | Development environment and the resource management console |
| Develop your OAuth flow for authentication | ☐ I understand that IAM supports Open ID Connect (OIDC). <br><br> ☐ I discovered my IAM regional endpoint and I successfully redirect users from `dashboard_url` to my assembled redirect URI, and I store the user's `access_token` returned in my response so it can be used during authentication. <br><br> | Users that visit your service dashboard must be correctly authenticated. Develop Open Authorization token-based authentication and authorization using {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM). Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis5-iam.html#oauth) to develop an OAuth flow for authentication. | Development environment and documentation|
| Validate user authorization | ☐ I can communicate with IAM to obtain an access token for an api key <br><br> ☐ I am able to validate authorization for the user to the service instance (/v2/authz POST). <br><br> | After developing your OAuth flow for authentication, you must validate that users will be correctly authorized, ensuring that users of your service have the ability to access your service dashboard. Follow the [guidance](/https://console.stage1.bluemix.net/docs/third-party/cis5-iam.html#validate) to validate user authorization. | Development environment and documentation |

## Publish and test your offering

| Task | Subtasks | Description | Environment |
|------| ----------| ------------|-----|
| Publish your offering in limited visibility mode | ☐ I successfully registered my hosted OSB in the resource management console **Deployments** page. <br><br> ☐ I successfully created new deployments in the resource management console **Deployments** page, and published my offering to one or more regions. <br><br> |  Now that you have your hosted broker or brokers that meet the OSB specification, you can return to the resource management console to publish your service to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis4-rmc-publish.html#publish-your-service-to-ibm-cloud) to publish your offering in limited visibility mode. | Resource management console |
| Test your offering | ☐ Signed in with my white-listed account, I can see my service in the https://console.bluemix.net catalog. <br><br> ☐ I successfully validated authentication from the service instance dashboard. <br><br> ☐ I successfully validated that my offering displays correctly in the catalog. <br><br> ☐ I successfully validated provisioning works; I can choose a plan and create a service instance. <br><br> ☐ I successfully validated that de-provision works; I can delete a service instance. <br><br> ☐ I successfully validated that bind works; I can click **Connections** and connect my service to another application. <br><br> ☐ I successfully validated that unbind works; I can disconnect my service and delete the connection. <br><br>  ☐ I successfully validated that Create service Key and Delete service Key work; I can click **Credentials**, generate a service key, and delete that service key. <br><br> ☐ I worked with my IBM representative to validate that my offering correctly supports the enable and disable endpoints. <br><br> ☐ Because my offering has a metered plan, I successfully tested usage submission by curling the usage API and correctly returning accurate pricing based on usage, and by enabling automated hourly submission to usage, supporting all users who provision an instance of my service. | Now that you have your hosted broker or brokers that meet the OSB specification, you can return to the resource management console to publish your service to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. Follow the [guidance](/docs/third-party/cis4-rmc-publish.html#test-your-deployed-offering) to test your deployed service. | {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console |
