# Step 6: Publicly releasing your service

Are you ready to go live? Have you tested your limited visibility service? If so, it's time to prepare for GA. Service providers must record a video, demonstrating that your finished service meets all requirements. You will submit to IBM via email. Your demo will be reviewed by IBM before final publish approval can be granted. Recordings are reviewed every Tuesday with a decision or feedback returned the following Thursday, so be sure to plan enough time to prepare for you go-live date.

This step assumes you have been approved to deliver a Commerce Integrated service. If you haven't yet completed the initial registration and approval in PWB, see: [Getting started publishing your third-party offering in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](/docs/third-party/index.html)

## Before you begin

Ensure you have started Step 1 and completed Steps 2, 3, 4, and 5:
1. [Author service docs and marketing announcement](/docs/third-party/cis1-docs-marketing.html).
2. [Define your offering in the resource management console](/docs/third-party/cis2-rmc-define.html).
3. [Develop and host your service brokers](/docs/third-party/cis3-broker.html).
3. [Develop an authentication flow](/docs/third-party/cis5-iam.html).
3. [Publishing and testing your service](/docs/third-party/cis4-rmc-publish.html)


## Record your demo

1. Work with your IBM representative to understand the requirements and exactly what you need to demonstrate.
1. Pick the recording software of your choice (Quicktime on macOS and Windows Media Palyer on Windows both offer free video and audio recording options).
2. Log into {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and start recording.

## Send your demo to IBM

Email your demo recording or recordings to servp@us.ibm.com.

Your demo will be reviewed by IBM before final publish approval can be granted. Recordings are reviewed every Tuesday with a decision or feedback returned the following Thursday, so be sure to plan enough time to prepare for you go-live date. An IBM approver will iterate via email until you meet all the requirements.

## After approval is granted, IBM will GA your service

When IBM approves your service, you will receive an email and IBM will coordinate the release of your General Availability service. IBM will move your service out of limited visibility mode and make it fully visible to your customers.
